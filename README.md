# Mindera Internship Project

## Challenge:
"Implement a dummy user interface that follows the wireframe shown in this video https://tinyurl.com/mindera-graduates-app. The interface can be built using any technology/platform. For example, Android (Java or Kotlin), iOS (ObjectiveC or Swift), web-based or hybrid technologies like React, React-Native, AngularJS, Angular5, etc."

## Solution:
This dummy interface is implemented in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
My first objective was to implement the interface using Swift, but since i don't have a mac, my options were limited.
After some search I decided to go with React Native in order to challenge myself to create something using a language I never learned at school.

## Instalation

1: Clone or download the repository.

2: Run 'npm install' on the cmd or Powershell (Before this step, make sure to have Node, python2 and JDK installed in the machine).

3: Configure the device/emulator (I ran the application on an external device using [this](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device) method).

4: Run the application using `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`.
